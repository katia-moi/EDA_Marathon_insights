# EDA_Marathon_insights
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on marathon results. The dataset includes training history, split times, and marathon performance metrics. 

This project aims to uncover key patterns in runners’ performance, identify factors that predict success, and analyze pacing strategies that influence whether runners “hit the wall.” Visualizations and insights are provided to better understand the dynamics of marathon running.
